# Fraud detection machine learning models
Research cum development Project on Comparison of various fraud detection models 

The project involves a systematic investigation of machine learning algorithms for fraud detection in financial transactions. It spans multiple phases: collecting and preprocessing real-world fraud data, selecting algorithms based on literature insights, and engineering features to enhance model capabilities. Training models using historical data involves optimization techniques and rigorous evaluation using standard metrics. The comparative analysis aims to highlight strengths and weaknesses, exploring ensemble methods for potential enhancements. A continuous feedback loop ensures ongoing refinement, while documented findings will guide future research in this domain.
